# Predictive-analysis-on-Term-Deposit-Subscription
Our project aims to increase campaign efficiency by identifying the main factors that affect the success of a campaign and predicting whether the campaign will be successful to a certain client, namely, whether the client will subscribe a term deposit or not. A term deposit is a fixed-term investment that requires the deposit of money at a financial institution for a fixed period, ranging from one month to a few years. Banks allocate a lot of expenses on their campaigns to promote their customer to subscribe to their term deposit which contributes a big fraction of their revenues. Increasing number of marketing campaigns over time has reduced their effects on the general public.
